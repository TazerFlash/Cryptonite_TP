This challenge starts with a common encryption idea used, called the XOR. XOR works similar to the XOR gate used in Digital system design. The logic basically is that
if theres two similar bits, it returns a 0, and when theres two bits thast are different, it returns 1. 

For this challenge, we are provided with a string, and each sharecter of the string is to be xor'd with the integer 13. 

We start by converting the string to its integer equivalent.
Later, we can use the ord() function from the python libraries to xor the charecterr with the integer directly, and the string is returned after its xor'd. 

The python code implementation for the same is attached in this directory under the name "xor1.py".
