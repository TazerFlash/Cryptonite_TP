Idea:
To implement diffie hellman key exchange algorithm, after encrypting the exchanged key with AES.

The cryptographic application for data security by using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the AES algorithm was to secure data when sending, the first sender of the
recipient exchanges the key or generated the key for the encrypted file by using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, after obtaining the key file would be encrypted by 
using AES algorithm for encryption and decryption file, sender would send file to receiver party through server first to save data, then recipient to decrypt file to 
read the file so that could be read back by receiver. In this assignment, the application that combined the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange with AES encryption algorithm. 
This application that first used Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange to achieve the goal of exchanging shared secret key. The results indicated that by using Diffie-Hellman with 
1024 bit keys the security was equivalent to 3DES 2 key algorithm, if Diffie-Hellman with 2048 bit key then its security equal to 3DES 3 key, if Diffie-Hellman with 
3072 bit key then equal security with AES-128 bits, if Diffie-Hellman with 7680 bit keys then the security was equivalent to AES-182 bits, and if Diffie-Hellman with
15360 bit keys then the security was equivalent to AES-256 bits.
