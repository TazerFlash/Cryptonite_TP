Thia challenge tells us about a change in the Euclidean algorithm, where the initial integers are multiplied and added with the Euclidean GCD results

The extended Euclidean algorithm is an efficient way to find integers u,v such that

a * u + b * v = gcd(a,b)

The Python code implementation for the same is attached in this directory under the name: "math2.py"
