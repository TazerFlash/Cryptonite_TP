This challenge instroduces us to the concept of base64 encryption, which is a lighter form of encryption.
The challenge provides us with a hex string. As done in the previous challenges, the hex string can be converted into a byte string/bytearray.
Later, the string can be converte intoits ASCII equivalent, which was done in the previous challenge as well. 
Now, the ASCII string can be converted to Base64 y udoing the python fucktion from the default libraries i.e. variable_name = base64.b64encode(Variable_name). 

The python code implementation for the same has been attached in the file called "Encode3.py"
