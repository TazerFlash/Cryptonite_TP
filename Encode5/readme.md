This challenge involved a recap of the previous challenges, where we had to apply all the types of basic decryption procedures, we had used for cracking 
the previous chalenges. 

This time around, the challenge involved running a json server, where random types of encryption were thrown at us, and we had to decrypt as prompted. 

This time around, we had to connect to a json server and then the server randomly threw any one of the previous challenges. As we decrypted/encrypted each challenges key, we reach the end of the challenge. 

Since I wasnt too familiar with the json scripting part, I had taken help from a few resources that were available online and made up the script for the server responses. 

The python code implementation for the same challenge is attached in this directory under the file name "Encode5.py".
