This challenge consists of two image files, named mython their bytes xor'd. For some reason, these
image files cannot be opened.

We use a few functions from the python image library, to gain access to the dimensions of the image, 
and the rgb pixel bytes of the images.

We start by opening the image files, and then extracting the details of the image get more information
about the unknown xor bytes.

first, we take the dimensions of the image into consideration and then take the rgb bytes.

After using the XORImage() functyion, we get the key.

The python code implementation of the same is attached in this directoy under the name: "xor5.py".
