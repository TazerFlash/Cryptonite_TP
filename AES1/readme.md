This challenge consists of a 2d array whoch consists the key in bytes form in each ndex.

We need to decode each element of the matrix and then print the final key out in plaintext.

We start this by converting each element by converting it from byte to plaintext. 
Next, we make another 1d array to hold the charecters of the 2d array, and later convert the 1d array to string to print the charecters.

The python code implementation for the same is attached in this directory under the name "aes1.py"
