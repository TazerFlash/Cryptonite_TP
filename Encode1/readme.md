This challenge involved an array with its respective ASCII codes, and hence the array was to be decrypted in order to get the flag.
The approach I chose to solve this challenge was to directly print the charecter equivalent of the integer, which helped me get the answer.

The code is attached in this directory under then name "Encode1.py".
