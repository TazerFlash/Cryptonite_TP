This challenge explains us about how messages can be encrypted using numbers and mathematical operations are applied
later and the message/data is recieved.
  
The pycryptodome library is used in this case and the long_to_bytes() is used from the library.

A number is provided to us, and later the number is to be converted into an understandable message. This can be cone by converting the number into bytes and then can be printed.
  
The python code implementation for the same is attached in a file called "Encode4.py".
